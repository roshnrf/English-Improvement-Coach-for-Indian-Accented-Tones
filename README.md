# English Improvement Coach for Indian-Accented Tones 🗣️🇮🇳

A real-time AI-based English coaching tool for Indian-accented speakers. This system takes user voice input, transcribes it using **OpenAI Whisper** and **HuBERT**, improves grammar with **GPT-3.5**, and plays back the corrected sentence using **Google Text-to-Speech** — creating a conversational loop via a **Gradio interface**.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Assist Indian English speakers in improving pronunciation and grammar in real-time by:
- Analyzing spoken input
- Generating corrected transcriptions
- Synthesizing native-like audio output

| UI                  | Gradio (for voice-to-voice interaction)                     |
| Evaluation          | Word Error Rate (WER) via `jiwer`                           |

## 🔁 How It Works

### 📌 Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](assets/architecture_diagram.png)

The process flow is:

1. 🎙️ **Audio input** from Svarah (Indian-accented English)
2. 🔊 Transcribed via **Whisper + HuBERT**
3. ✍️ Text corrected using **GPT-3.5 grammar model**
4. 🔁 Converted back into native-style audio via **Google TTS**

## 📁 Dataset

We used the **Svarah** dataset — a high-quality Indian-accented English speech dataset featuring audio clips across diverse regional accents.

- 📄 Citation available in the section below
- 💾 Format: `.wav` audio files
- 🧠 Suitable for ASR, pronunciation evaluation, and accent-specific NLP

## 🛠️ Code Highlights

```python
# Transcribe using Whisper and HuBERT
transcription_whisper = transcribe_whisper(audio_path)
transcription_hubert = transcribe_hubert(audio_path)

# Correct grammar using GPT-3.5 model
corrected_text = correct_text(transcription_whisper)

# Convert to native-sounding audio
text_to_speech(corrected_text, "output.mp3")

# Evaluate accuracy using Word Error Rate
accuracy = calculate_accuracy(ground_truth, corrected_text)
```

## 📊 Sample Output

```
Original:     so because when I have to make payment I do it by Apple Pay
Whisper:      So because when I have to make payment, I do it by April pay.
HuBERT:       SO BECAUSE WHEN I HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENT I DO IT BY A PULPET
Corrected Whisper: So when I have to make payment, I do it by April pay.
Corrected HuBERT:  When I have to make payment I do it by a pulpet.
Whisper Accuracy: 85.71%
HuBERT Accuracy:  71.43%
```

✔️ Outputs saved as:

## 🔮 Future Work

- Accent-specific fine-tuning of models (e.g., region-wise Svarah subsets)
- Add multilingual support (e.g., Hinglish, Tamil-English)
- Use Whisper Large + Tortoise TTS for better voice realism
- Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Cloud for public demo
